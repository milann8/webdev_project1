    <h1>Why does Milan love music?</h1>
    <p>Music is honestly a huge part of my life because it can change my whole mood in like two seconds. Whether I’m sad, mad, or happy, there’s always a song that just gets it. That’s why I love it so much, it’s like my personal escape from everything.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>This is my all-time favorite song. I gatekeep this song because I love it so much. It is the perfect late night song!</li>

        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EjZF88vqNU">"Sweet Thing" by Mary J. Blige</a>
            <ul>
                <li>This song always lifts up my spirits. It is a "happy" song! This is the song I go to when I am feeling down because as soon as I hear the first three notes of the guitar, it feels as if nothing else matters.</li>
